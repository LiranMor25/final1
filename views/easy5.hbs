          <h1>Dallas Mavericks trade Prozinges mid-game, leading to an awkward finish on the bench</h1>
	    <h2> With the NBA trade deadline fast-approaching, teams are eager to make every move they can to improve their position, whether that means preparing for a playoff push or rebuilding with future seasons in mind.
 The move would have been fairly standard trade deadline fodder if not for one awkward detail â€” Prozinges was on the court playing for the Mavericks when the news of the trade broke.</h2>
